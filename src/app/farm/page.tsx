In addition to breeding at our own facilities, Lumii works closely with selected households who raise fish 
for us under natural conditions. We provide fishlings to these communities and conduct monthly inspections 
to ensure proper care, water quality, and healthy growth. Priority is always given to families with natural 
water sources such as springs and rivers, where fish can thrive in a healthy environment. By working together, 
we create opportunities for local communities while maintaining strict standards of quality for our customers.

Before export, all fish pass through our dedicated quarantine center for a minimum of three weeks. 
During this period, they are carefully observed to ensure they are free from disease, growing to the 
right maturity, and maintaining calm behavior. Our quarantine process reflects our commitment to 
international standards, giving customers confidence that every fish is healthy and ready for its new environment. 
This step is central to our promise of delivering only the best.
