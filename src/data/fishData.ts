// src/data/fishData.ts

// 1. Define and Export the 'Fish' Type
// This is what your FishCard.tsx component is missing. It describes the
// "shape" of a single fish object for TypeScript.
export type Fish = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  primaryImage: string;
  category: 'Glow' | 'Pattern' | 'Crew';
  species: string;
  description: string;
};

// 2. Your Existing Data Array
// By adding ': Fish[]', we tell TypeScript that this is an array of 'Fish' objects.
// This is good practice as it will show an error if an object doesn't match the type.
